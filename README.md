# ‚ö°Ô∏èFleek Next Adapter

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

The Fleek Next.js adapter allows you to deploy your server-side Next.js application on Fleek.

# Installation

- **npm**

```bash
npm install @fleek-platform/next
```

- **pnpm**

```bash
pnpm install @fleek-platform/next
```

# Usage

To build and prepare your Next.js application for deployment on Fleek, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Edge Runtime**
   Add the following code to any routes that run server-side code to ensure they run on the edge:

```typescript
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

2. **Build**

Use the Fleek Next.js adapter to build and deploy your application via the command line:

```sh
npx fleek-next build
# or if installed globally
fleek-next build
```

If you are running the command outside of your project's root dir, you can set the path to it with the project path flag `-p`/`--projectPath`:

```sh
fleek-next build -p path/to/my/repo
```

The `build` command supports several options to customize the build and deployment process:

- `-p, --project-path <path>`: The path to your Next.js project's root directory. Defaults to the path where the command is run.
- `-s, --skipBuild`: Skip building the Next.js app before deployment, useful if you want to build the application yourself due to any possible extra steps. Defaults to `false`.
- `-i, --skipInstallation`: Skip installing the dependencies. Defaults to `false`.
- `-c, --clean`: Clean previous build artifacts before building.
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging.

3. **Deploy your function:**

Use the [Fleek CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/cli) to deploy your function:

```sh
fleek functions deploy --noBundle --name '<name of your function>' --path .fleek/dist/index.js
```

# Release Process

This project follows SemVer for versioning. Here's how to release a new version:

1. **Update Version Number**: Bump the version number in package.json using npm version (patch/minor/major). This will update the version number in package.json and create a new Git tag.

```bash
pnpm version patch
```

2. **Push Changes and Tags**

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

3. **GitHub Actions Automation**: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically publishes the package to npm when a new tag is pushed.
