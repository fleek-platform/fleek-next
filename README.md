The Fleek Next CLI allows you to deploy your server-side Next.js application on Fleek. This CLI is currently in an experimental stage.

## Features

- Deploy Next.js applications to Fleek Network
- Support for edge functions
- Serverless deployment
- Easy configuration and setup

# Installation

- **npm**

```bash
npm install @fleekxyz/next
```

- **pnpm**

```bash
pnpm install @fleekxyz/next
```

# Usage

To deploy your Next.js application to Fleek, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Edge Runtime**
   Add the following code to any routes that run server-side code to ensure they run on the edge:

```typescript
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

2. **Set environment variables**

```sh
export FLEEK_PROJECT_ID=<your project id>
export FLEEK_PAT=<your personal access token>
```

3. **Build and Deploy**

Use the Fleek Next CLI to build and deploy your application:

```sh
npx fleek-next
```

## Additional Options

The `build` command supports several options to customize the build and deployment process:

- `-d, --dryrun`: Builds the Next.js app without deploying it to Fleek. Defaults to `false`.
- `-p, --project-path <path>`: The path to your Next.js project's root directory. Defaults to the path where the command is run.
- `-s, --skipBuild`: Skip building the Next.js app before deployment, useful if you want to build the application yourself due to any possible extra steps. Defaults to `false`.
- `-c, --clean`: Clean previous build artifacts before building.
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging.

# Release Process

This project follows SemVer for versioning. Here's how to release a new version:

1. **Update Version Number**: Bump the version number in package.json using npm version (patch/minor/major). This will update the version number in package.json and create a new Git tag.

```bash
pnpm version patch
```

2. **Push Changes and Tags**

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

3. **GitHub Actions Automation**: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically publishes the package to npm when a new tag is pushed.
